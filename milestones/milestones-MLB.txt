Project 4 
Teaching A Machine To Fly A Rocket


Description:
In this project, we will teach a machine to land an EDF rocket. We will accomplish this by training a model to land a virtual rocket safely on the ground. If we are satisfied with our results, we will move onto testing this in the real-world with a physical EDF Rocket.


Tasks To Complete:
        ML environment
                > Blender Rigid Body World Setup
                        > Physics Setup
                > C++ to Python Blender API
                        > Allow us to use C++ with the Python API
                > Neuron and Brain setup
                > Generational System
                        > Allows us to record the changes from each generation.
                > Positive Reinforcement Criteria
                        > EX: “Landed” model will continue to next generation.
                > Negative Reinforcement Criteria
                        > EX: “Crashed” model will not continue to next generation.
        Physical Rocket
                > Human written control program
                > PID solver
                > GPIO Control
                        > PWM
                                > Servo Controller
                        > SPI interfacer
                                > SD CARD
                                > Various Sensors
                        > I2C
                                > Gyroscopic sensor
                                > Various Sensors
                > ML Interfacing
                        > ML final version should natively be able to control rocket’s attitude.
