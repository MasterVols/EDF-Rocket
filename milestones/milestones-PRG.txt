RUBRIC ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
10 points – The whole of the project demonstrates a clear of the material learned up to this point in our cs courses.

10 points – All of the code included in the project compiles and performs a clear function

10 points – All code created for the project at least attempts to reach some specified goal outlined by the whole group.

10 points – The individual member has demonstrated a clear contribution to the larger project


TASKS  TO COMPLETE ----------------------------------------------------------------

** This was mostly outlined inside Mathew’s milestones, however, his were mostly made for the group, I will outline
some of my personal goals because I operate better with individualized, and specified tasks.

	- Figure out what Matthew has actually made
	- Create my own brain
	- Create the files necessary to interpret the outputs of 	our models (this will be done probably later)
	- Begin the process of developing the rest of the
	code that we will use to integrate our neural networks
	into the larger project (this will be done later)
