TIME LOG-------------------------------------------------------
Time Logged in Lab: 2 hours

Time Begun Outside of Lab: March 05, 2023 @ 12:00 am

	- March 05, 2023 12:00am to 1:30 am
		I began analyzing the code already written by
		Matthew and I began designing the structure of 
		my neuralnetwork
	- March 05, 2023 5:30 pm to 7:00 pm
		I began creating the code for my project and
		started to write some suporting documents
		to help others understand the structure of
		network.
	- March 05, 2023 9:30 pm to 11:00 pm
		I continued to create the code for my brain.
		I started working on some of the logic which
		will be used inside of my main file, and else
		where in my implementation
		
	- March 27, 2023 9:40 pm to 11:20 pm
		I Started creating the classes that will be
		used for my implementation of the ffann. I
		also researched common implimentations of 
		feed forward artificial neural networks.

	- April 08, 2023 1:40 pm to 5:10 pm
		I finished creating funcitons for my neural
		network. There is still an unidentified error
		in my generate_network funciton

	- April 10, 2023 8:00 pm to April 11, 2023 12:00 am
		I finished the neural network. The final
		version uses only one class. I also created
		a helper funtio to print out the network
		so it can be more easily

RUBRIC ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
10 points – The whole of the project demonstrates a clear of
	    the material learned up to this point in our cs
	    courses.

10 points – All of the code included in the project compiles
	    and performs a clear function

10 points – All code created for the project at least attempts
	    to reach some specified goal outlined by the whole
	    group.

10 points – The individual member has demonstrated a clear
	    contribution to the larger project


TASKS  TO COMPLETE ----------------------------------------------------------------

** This was mostly outlined inside Mathew’s milestones,
   however, his were mostly made for the group, I will
   outline some of my personal goals because I operate better
   with individualized, and specified tasks.

	- Figure out what Matthew has actually made
	- Create the files necessary to interpret the outputs
	  of our models (this will be done probably later)
	- Begin the process of developing the rest of the
	code that we will use to integrate our neural networks
	into the larger project (this will be done later)
