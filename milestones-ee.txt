Overview:

    In this project, each member of our team is going to implement their own deep learning data structure (mostly feed forward neural networks to my knowledge)
    in order to try to land a rocket in a simulation. If we successfully simulate the landing of a rocket, we may launch a real rocket with these controls. 

    Personally, my goal is to make a standard feed forward neural network from scratch. I am implementing a neural_network class and a neuron class
    to make my structure. I will be implementing the neural network, a training system, and backpropagation as a training algorithm by which to 
    hopefully fly a rocket.

    For a compilable result for challenge 4, I have a main.cpp which will create the neural_network data structure including:
    an input layer of neurons, a hidden layer of neurons, an output layer of neurons, and weights and biases.

    *Note: I am struggling with an out of bounds error in my neural_network constructor when trying to create
    all of the weights and biases in the hidden layer, so I have temporarily commented out that section of code. 
    When the create_network file is run, the weights and biases of the hidden layer will not be displayed, but it would 
    look similar to the input and output layer.  

    Compile with: g++ -o create_network create_network.cpp neural_network.cpp neuron.cpp

Time Log:

    3 hours - outlining neural_network and neuron classes as well as a connection class that is no longer necessary
            - mainly added basic functions that would be necessary and thinking through how the data structure will operate
    
    1.5 hours - video series outlining how neural networks operate
              - 4 videos by 3Blue1Brown on youtube in Neural Network playlist
              - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi

    2 hours - began reading book by Micheal Nielson about neural networks

Rubric (40 points): 

    - 30 points: successfully create a deep learning data structure
      that attempts to train itself to guide a simulated model rocket
            - 10 points: create a data structure that has the ability to learn how land a simulated rocket
            - 10 points: create a methodology in which the data structure will attempt to train itself (simulation/training data)
            - 10 points: create an algorithm by which the data structure will adjust its settings based on its success or failure during training
    - 10 points: final submission compiles and attempts to complete the above tasks
